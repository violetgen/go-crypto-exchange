# Folder Structure

Citation: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

## Current Directories Structure

### `/docs`

Design and user documents (in addition to your godoc generated documentation).

### `/examples`

Examples for your applications and/or public libraries.

### `/internal`

Private application and library code. This is the code you don't want others importing in their applications or libraries.

Put your actual application code in the `/internal/app` directory (e.g., `/internal/app/myapp`) and the code shared by those apps in the `/internal/pkg` directory (e.g., `/internal/pkg/myprivlib`).

### `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations. These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple.

## Directories You Shouldn't Have

### `/src`

Some Go projects do have a `src` folder, but it usually happens when the devs came from the Java world where it's a common pattern. If you can help yourself try not to adopt this Java pattern. You really don't want your Go code or Go projects to look like Java :-)

Don't confuse the project level `/src` directory with the `/src` directory Go uses for its workspaces as described in [`How to Write Go Code`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). The `$GOPATH` environment variable points to your (current) workspace (by default it points to `$HOME/go` on non-windows systems). This workspace includes the top level `/pkg`, `/bin` and `/src` directories. Your actual project ends up being a sub-directory under `/src`, so if you have the `/src` directory in your project the project path will look like this: `/some/path/to/workspace/src/your_project/src/your_code.go`. Note that with Go 1.11 it's possible to have your project outside of your `GOPATH`, but it still doesn't mean it's a good idea to use this layout pattern.
